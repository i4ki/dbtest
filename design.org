* DBTEST:: Database testing tool

This tool was created to help in the comparisons between PostgreSQL
and cockcroachdb clusters. It must support index the same dataset in
both technologies in the same way and then measure simple and complex
queries on this dataset.

** Datasets

Initially we'll use *Reddit entire dataset* available to download in
the following URL:

https://www.reddit.com/r/datasets/comments/3bxlg7/i_have_every_publicly_available_reddit_comment/

Example json:

#+BEGIN_SRC json
{
	"gilded": 0,
	"author_flair_text": "Male",
	"author_flair_css_class": "male",
	"retrieved_on": 1425124228,
	"ups": 3,
	"subreddit_id": "t5_2s30g",
	"edited": false,
	"controversiality": 0,
	"parent_id": "t1_cnapn0k",
	"subreddit": "AskMen",
	"body": "I can't agree with passing the blame, but I'm glad to hear it's at least helping you with the anxiety. I went the other direction and started taking responsibility for everything. I had to realize that people make mistakes including myself and it's gonna be alright. I don't have to be shackled to my mistakes and I don't have to be afraid of making them. ",
	"created_utc": "1420070668",
	"downs": 0,
	"score": 3,
	"author": "TheDukeofEtown",
	"archived": false,
	"distinguished": null,
	"id": "cnasd6x",
	"score_hidden": false,
	"name": "t1_cnasd6x",
	"link_id": "t3_2qyhmp"
}
#+END_SRC

JSON Records are separated by newline (\n).

** Interface

Below are various expected command utilities:

#+BEGIN_SRC nash
cat file.json | dbtest json2sql --schema schema.json --table "reddit" --database "reddit"
USE DATABASE = "reddit";
INSERT INTO `reddit` (gilded, author_flair_text, author_flair_css_class,
                      retrieved_on, ups, subreddit_id, edited, controversiality,
                      parent_id, subreddit, ...)
    VALUES (0, "Male", "male", 1425124228, 3, "t5_2s30g", false, 0, "t1_cnapn0k", ...);
}
#+END_SRC
